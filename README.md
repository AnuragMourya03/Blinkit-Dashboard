# Blinkit Dashboard

### 1. Project Title: Blinkit Sales Analytics

A dynamic, interactive data visualization dashboard designed to track and analyze retail performance across various outlet types, locations, and item categories to optimize quick commerce delivery operations.

### 2. Project Purpose

The **Blinkit Sales Insights Dashboard** is a strategic dashboard that visualizes **$1.2M in total sales** across diverse retail outlets. It provides a granular look at consumer preferences (such as fat content and item types) and outlet efficiency (size and location tiers) to help stakeholders drive revenue growth and improve inventory management.

### 3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built entirely using Microsoft Excel, using its features such as:

* Excel Pivot Tables: Used to aggregate and summarize over 8,524 items into meaningful categories like Outlet Size and Location.

* Excel Formulas: Utilized functions to calculate dynamic KPIs like Avg Sales ($141) and Avg Rating (4.0).

* Power Query: Employed within Excel to clean, shape, and transform the raw grocery data before analysis.

* Excel Dashboard Design: Developed a custom user interface using shapes, slicers, and different kinds of charts to mimic software application like Power BI

### 4. Data Source

The data for this project was sourced from Kaggle, a popular platform for data science and analysis. After downloading the raw file, I processed the data to ensure accuracy before beginning the analysis.

### 5. Features & Highlights

#### **A) The Business Problem**

Blinkit needs to identify which outlet configurations (size vs. location) have the highest ROI and whether specific product types for example (Low Fat vs. Regular) perform differently across tiers.

#### **B) Goal of the Dashboard**

To provide an higher level summary of the sales data while allowing departments to filter down the specific item types or outlet years.

#### **C) Key Visuals & Walkthrough**

* **Fat Content Donut Chart:** Shows the split between Low Fat ($776.3K) and Regular Fat ($425.4K) sales.
* **Item Type Bar Chart:** A ranked list of 16 categories, identifying Fruits and Vegetables ($178.1K) and Snack Foods ($175.4K) as the top selling items.
* **Fat by Outlet Stacked Bar:** Breaks down fat content preferences across Tier 1, 2, and 3 locations.
* **Outlet Establishment Line Chart:** An area line chart tracking the growth of outlets from 2011 to 2022, highlighting a peak year in 2018 ($204.5K).
* **Outlet Size Pie Chart:** A distribution chart showing that Medium sized outlets contribute the largest share ($507.9K) of revenue.
* **Outlet Location Bar Chart:** A clear comparison showing Tier 3 as the leading revenue generator ($472.1K).

#### **D) Business Impact & Insights**

* **Tier 3 Dominance:** With $472.1K in sales, Tier 3 locations outperform Tiers 1 and 2, suggesting a massive growth opportunity in suburban or developing areas.
* **Inventory Focus:** "Fruits and Vegetables" and "Snack Foods" are the top selling categories ($178K and $175K respectively), indicating these should be prioritized for the delivery speed.
